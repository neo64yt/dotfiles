Instead of keeping lists of what to block, Privacy Badger automatically discovers trackers based on their behavior.\n\nPrivacy Badger sends the Global Privacy Control signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the Do Not Track signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore your wishes, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.\n\nBesides automatic tracker blocking, Privacy Badger replaces potentially useful trackers (video players, comments widgets, etc.) with click-to-activate placeholders, and removes outgoing link click tracking on Facebook and Google, with more privacy protections on the way.\n\nTo learn more, see the FAQ on Privacy Badger's homepage.","weeklyDownloads":16048,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"EFF Technologists","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5474073/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/225/225184.png?modified=1569261286","width":1920,"height":1080,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/225/225184.png?modified=1569261286","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":360,"caption":"Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/171/171793.png?modified=1569261279","width":700,"height":394,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/171/171793.png?modified=1569261279","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":360,"caption":"Privacy Badger at work on the whitehouse.gov privacy policy page."}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/SupportEFF?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.7857,"reviewCount":410,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/reviews/","updateDate":1607941528000},{"id":"https-everywhere@eff.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"HTTPS Everywhere","version":"2020.11.17","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3679479/https_everywhere-2020.11.17-an+fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere","supportURL":"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere","description":"Encrypt the web!
